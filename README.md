# mami-ear
Speech and audio modules for the MaMi project

This is a Node.js application which is designed to run in a Raspberry Pi machine. All the node modules have been precompiled to ARM architecture so the application does not run in MacOS or x86 Linux without recompiling the modules.

To test the application, just run:

  ```
  $ node index.js
  ```
